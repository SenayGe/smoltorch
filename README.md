# SmolTorch
A lightweight PyTorch-like autograd engine, you probably will never use.
It can train GPT2 though (yes, yes it's an LLM) 

> Note: its still a work in progress. I will add the results from training a GPT-2 model once I am done.

### Features
- Numpy/MLX-backed tensor operations
- Automatic differentiation (autograd), backprobag, all that stuff
- Native Apple Silicon support via MLX
